   - Consistent API response times across platforms

5. **Updated Non-Functional Requirements (R10-R13)**
   - Enhanced performance requirements including .claude file operations (<1s)
   - Added reliability requirements for file system operations with rollback
   - Enhanced security with file access controls and command sandboxing
   - Added scalability requirements for multi-tenant isolation

6. **Updated Technical Requirements (R14-R16)**
   - Added file system abstraction layer and command execution framework
   - Enhanced data formats with metadata structures and command schemas
   - Added file system and markdown parsing library dependencies

### Source Analysis Integration

New requirements derived from:

- **ASK.md**: Primary requirements for MCP APIs and IDE integration
- **.claude/claude-instructions.md**: Universal project standards and workflows
- **.claude/agents/personas-index.md**: 70+ personas across development specializations
- **.claude/agents/instructions/**: 20+ language-specific instruction files
- **GitHub Copilot instructions**: Comprehensive coding and management guidelines

### Acceptance Criteria Enhancement

- Added 15 new acceptance criteria for .claude directory operations
- Enhanced performance benchmarks with file operation timing requirements
- Added security validation for command execution sandboxing
- Multi-IDE integration validation across 4 platforms

### Persona Mapping Added

Defined specific persona responsibilities:

- **MCP Integration**: `mcp-expert.md` (lead), `senior-nodejs-developer.md` (support)
- **Multi-IDE Integration**: `vscode-extension-developer.md` (lead), `api-developer.md` (support)
- **File Operations**: `senior-nodejs-developer.md` (lead), `security-engineer.md` (review)
- **Documentation**: `technical-writer.md` (lead), `qa-engineer.md` (support)

### Requirements Renumbering

- Functional requirements: R1-R9 (added R8, R9)
- Non-functional requirements: R10-R13 (renumbered from R8-R11)
- Technical requirements: R14-R16 (renumbered from R12-R14)
- Compliance requirements: R17-R19 (renumbered from R15-R17)
- Environment requirements: R20-R21 (renumbered from R18-R19)

### Validation Status

✅ **Complete**: All ASK.md requirements integrated into REQUIREMENTS.md  
✅ **Aligned**: Requirements mapped to existing .claude persona and instruction structure  
✅ **Testable**: 62 total acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes  
✅ **Production-Ready**: Clear requirement identifiers with detailed sub-requirements  
⚠️ **TODO**: Validate command schema format when .claude/commands structure is created

### Next Steps

1. Implement R5 MCP server enhancements for .claude directory access
2. Develop R8 file system abstraction layer with atomic operations
3. Design R9 command execution framework with plugin architecture
4. Create R7 multi-IDE integration testing framework
5. Establish command schema validation against future .claude/commands structure

## Version 2025.08.11-00001

**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Change Type**: Initial Creation  
**Author**: Claude Code

### Summary of Changes

Created comprehensive `REQUIREMENTS.md` from codebase analysis since no existing `ASK.md` or `REQUIREMENTS.md` files were found.

### Major Changes

1. **New Document Creation**
   - Analyzed existing codebase to infer functional and non-functional requirements
   - Created 19 major requirement categories (R1-R19) with detailed sub-requirements
   - Established acceptance criteria for all functional requirements

2. **Functional Requirements Added**
   - **R1**: HTTP API Server requirements with health checks and error handling
   - **R2**: Rule Management for GitHub integration and bundled packs
   - **R3**: Diff Processing for code change analysis
   - **R4**: Compliance Checking with security and policy validation
   - **R5**: MCP Server Integration for Claude connectivity
   - **R6**: VS Code Extension capabilities
   - **R7**: GitHub Integration with App authentication and PR reviews

3. **Non-Functional Requirements Added**
   - **R8**: Performance benchmarks (2s response time, 100 concurrent connections)
   - **R9**: Reliability standards (99.9% uptime, graceful error handling)
   - **R10**: Security requirements (secure key storage, input validation)
   - **R11**: Scalability requirements (horizontal scaling, stateless design)

4. **Technical & Compliance Requirements**
   - **R12**: Architecture specifications (TypeScript, ES modules, Express.js)
   - **R13**: Data format standards (JSON, unified diff, Markdown)
   - **R14**: Dependency management guidelines
   - **R15**: Code quality standards (80% test coverage, TypeScript strict mode)
   - **R16**: Documentation requirements
   - **R17**: Licensing compliance
   - **R18**: Runtime environment specifications
   - **R19**: Configuration management

### Source Analysis

Requirements were derived from analysis of:

- **Core source files**: `src/server.ts`, `src/mcp.ts`, `src/*.ts` modules
- **Package configuration**: `package.json` scripts and dependencies
- **Container setup**: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`
- **Bundled guidance packs**: 6 compliance frameworks in `bundled/` directory
- **VS Code extension**: `vscode-extension/` structure
- **GitHub integration**: Copilot instructions and app manifest patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

- 47 specific, testable acceptance criteria defined
- Performance benchmarks established for all major operations
- Security validation requirements specified
- Integration test scenarios documented

### Future Considerations

Marked the following as out-of-scope for initial version:

- Machine learning model training
- Real-time collaboration features
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Custom rule DSL

### Validation Status

✅ **Complete**: All inferred requirements documented with unique identifiers  
✅ **Testable**: Acceptance criteria defined for functional requirements  
✅ **Measurable**: Performance and quality metrics specified  
⚠️ **TODO**: No existing `ASK.md` found - requirements based solely on codebase analysis  
⚠️ **TODO**: No `.claude/` instruction files found - persona/instruction alignment not validated

### Next Steps

1. Validate requirements against stakeholder expectations
2. Create `ASK.md` if additional high-level goals need documentation
3. Establish `.claude/agents/` structure if persona-driven development is desired
4. Review and refine performance benchmarks based on production needs
