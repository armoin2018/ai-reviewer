## Known Limitations

### LIMIT-2025.08.11-001 - GitHub API Rate Limiting

**Category**: Integration  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Status**: Acknowledged

#### Description

GitHub API has rate limits that may affect rule loading performance during high usage periods.

#### Mitigation Strategy

- Implement aggressive caching for GitHub API responses
- Use conditional requests with ETag headers
- Implement request queuing and retry logic
- Document rate limit handling for users

#### Related Requirements

- R11.2 - Graceful handling of GitHub API rate limits

### LIMIT-2025.08.11-002 - MCP Protocol Evolution

**Category**: Integration  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Status**: Monitoring

#### Description

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an evolving specification that may introduce breaking changes.

#### Mitigation Strategy

- Monitor MCP specification updates closely
- Implement version compatibility checking
- Maintain fallback to HTTP API interface
- Version lock MCP dependencies appropriately

#### Related Requirements

- R5 - MCP Server Integration

### LIMIT-2025.08.11-003 - Multi-IDE Testing Complexity

**Category**: Testing  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Status**: Planned

#### Description

Testing across multiple IDEs (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, WindSurf, Claude Code) requires diverse development environments.

#### Mitigation Strategy

- Set up containerized testing environments
- Create automated testing scripts for each IDE
- Implement integration testing framework
- Document manual testing procedures

#### Related Requirements

- R7 - Multi-IDE Integration and Support

## Security Considerations

### SEC-2025.08.11-001 - File System Access Controls

**Category**: Security  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Design Phase

#### Description

.claude directory operations require careful access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of project instructions and personas.

#### Security Measures

- Implement file permission validation
- Add audit logging for all file operations
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Implement atomic operations with rollback capability

#### Related Requirements

- R12.6 - File system access controls for .claude directory operations
- R8 - Claude Directory Management

### SEC-2025.08.11-002 - Command Execution Sandboxing

**Category**: Security  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Design Phase

#### Description

Command execution framework needs proper sandboxing to prevent privilege escalation and unauthorized system access.

#### Security Measures

- Implement command execution in restricted environment
- Validate all command parameters against schemas
- Limit file system and network access for commands
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

#### Related Requirements

- R12.7 - Command execution sandboxing and privilege restrictions
- R9 - Commands Integration

## Performance Notes

### PERF-2025.08.11-001 - Response Time Optimization

**Category**: Performance  
**Target**: <2s API response, <500ms commands, <1s file ops  
**Status**: Design Phase

#### Optimization Areas

1. **API Responses**: Caching, async processing, connection pooling
2. **Command Execution**: JIT compilation, result caching, parallel execution
3. **File Operations**: Memory mapping, batch operations, concurrent I/O

#### Monitoring Strategy

- Implement detailed performance metrics
- Set up alerting for SLA violations
- Create performance regression testing
- Monitor memory usage and connection counts

#### Related Requirements

- R10 - Performance Requirements
- R11.5 - File system operations with atomic updates
