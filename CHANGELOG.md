- **Team Size**: 4-6 developers across multiple personas
- **Deployment**: Container orchestration ready (Kubernetes/Docker Swarm)

### Dependencies Identified
- **External**: GitHub API, MCP protocol specification, IDE extension APIs
- **Internal**: .claude directory structure, persona/instruction alignment
- **Security**: File system permissions, command execution sandboxing
- **Performance**: Caching strategies, async processing capabilities
