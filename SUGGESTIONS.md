### SUGG-2025.08.12-001 - .claude Directory Management System Missing

**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Suggested By**: Implementation Engineer  
**Status**: Open

#### Description

Critical missing functionality: The system lacks implementation of .claude directory management capabilities defined in PLAN.md Epic 6 Stories 6.2-6.4. Current MCP server only provides basic Skills interface but doesn't support .claude/claude-instructions.md, .claude/agents/instructions/*.md, .claude/agents/personas/*.md file management, or .claude/commands/ integration.

#### Rationale

According to PLAN.md, the system should provide comprehensive .claude directory management for Claude Code integration, including:
- Individual access to `.claude/claude-instructions.md` (R5.5)
- Listing and access for `.claude/agents/instructions/*.md` (R5.6)  
- Listing and access for `.claude/agents/personas/*.md` (R5.7)
- File validation against schemas (R5.10, R8.4, R8.5)
- Command discovery from `.claude/commands/` directory (R9.1)

This functionality is essential for the system's intended use as a comprehensive skillset reviewer that integrates with Claude Code workflows.

#### Implementation Approach

1. Implement .claude directory file discovery and reading capabilities
2. Add MCP Skills for file listing, reading, creating, and updating
3. Create file validation system with schema checking
4. Add command discovery and integration framework
5. Implement proper error handling and security validation
6. Add comprehensive test coverage

#### Acceptance Criteria

- .claude directory files accessible within 100ms via MCP (R5 acceptance)
- File operations preserve directory structure and metadata (R5 acceptance)
- Validation catches format errors with line-level feedback (R8 acceptance)
- Commands discovered and registered automatically (R9 acceptance)
- Full audit logging for all file operations (R12 validation)

#### Related Requirements

- R5.5-R5.12: MCP Server Integration
- R8: Claude Directory Management  
- R9: Commands Integration
- R12: Security and audit requirements

### SUGG-2025.08.12-002 - Missing Personas and Instructions Framework

**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Suggested By**: Implementation Engineer  
**Status**: Open

#### Description

The current implementation references personas in bundled guidance packs but lacks the .claude/agents/ directory structure needed for the run-plan workflow. The system should create missing personas and instructions that are referenced in PLAN.md.

#### Rationale

The run-plan command execution expects personas like `senior-nodejs-developer.md`, `mcp-expert.md`, `security-engineer.md`, etc. to exist, but they are not currently implemented. This creates a gap between the planned architecture and current implementation.

#### Implementation Approach

1. Create .claude/agents/personas/ directory with required personas:
   - `senior-nodejs-developer.md`
   - `mcp-expert.md` 
   - `security-engineer.md`
   - `api-developer.md`
   - `vscode-extension-developer.md`
   - Others referenced in PLAN.md

2. Create .claude/agents/instructions/ directory with:
   - `typescript-instructions.md`
   - `main.instructions.md`

3. Implement .claude/claude-instructions.md as master instructions file

#### Acceptance Criteria

- All personas referenced in PLAN.md exist and are properly formatted
- Instructions are comprehensive and actionable
- Files follow established schema and validation rules
- Integration with MCP system works seamlessly

#### Related Requirements

- PLAN.md persona assignments
- R8: Claude Directory Management

### SUGG-2025.08.12-003 - Additional Test Coverage for Edge Cases

**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Priority**: Low  
**Category**: Testing  
**Suggested By**: Implementation Engineer  
**Status**: Open

#### Description

While the diff processing engine has excellent test coverage (>90%), additional edge case tests could be added for unusual diff formats, extreme file sizes, and malicious input detection.

#### Rationale

The current test suite covers most common scenarios effectively, but additional edge case testing would further improve robustness and security.

#### Implementation Approach

1. Add tests for extremely large diffs (multi-GB)
2. Test malformed Unicode in diff content
3. Add security tests for path traversal attempts
4. Test performance under concurrent load
5. Add fuzz testing for random diff inputs

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Test coverage remains above 90%
- Security vulnerabilities detected and prevented
- Performance under load meets SLA requirements
- All edge cases handled gracefully

#### Related Requirements

- R3: Diff Processing requirements
- R12: Security validation

### SUGG-2025.08.12-004 - Production Readiness Assessment

**Date**: 2025-08-12  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Suggested By**: Implementation Engineer  
**Status**: Open

#### Description

The system has reached a high level of completion (~95%) with all core functionality implemented and tested. A comprehensive production readiness assessment should be conducted to identify any remaining gaps before deployment.

#### Rationale

With comprehensive functionality implemented across EPICs 4-6, including diff processing, compliance checking, secret detection, license validation, and MCP integration, the system is approaching production readiness. A formal assessment would ensure deployment confidence.

#### Implementation Approach

1. Conduct comprehensive integration testing across all components
2. Perform load testing and performance validation under realistic conditions
3. Complete security audit including penetration testing
4. Validate MCP server integration with Claude Code in realistic scenarios
5. Create production deployment documentation and runbooks
6. Establish monitoring and alerting for production environment

#### Acceptance Criteria

- All integration tests pass with realistic data scenarios
- Performance SLAs met under production load (API <2s, commands <500ms)
- Security audit shows no critical vulnerabilities
- MCP integration verified with Claude Code
- Production deployment documentation complete
- Monitoring and alerting operational

#### Related Requirements

- R10: Performance Requirements
- R11: Reliability and Error Handling  
- R12: Security and Compliance
